                Created an Android app that allows users to send anonymous messages by bouncing them through nodes(other
                users) similar to how Onion routing works. At first I was going to use WiFi-Direct, but users would have
                to follow a prompt to connect to each other every time they re-opened the app. Because this would be a
                major UX limitation, I switched to Bluetooth since connections are saved and multiple could be connected
                at one time.
