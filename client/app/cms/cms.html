                The problem I solved: If someone from HR or Marketing wanted to push a new page for a job post or an
                event to the company's website, they would have to write up the post, send that to someone else to format
                it in HTML, and then that person sends it to someone else to deploy to the production server.

                How I solved it: An administrative interface with user login and admin login. Someone in HR or Marketing
                writes the post in a WYSIWYG editor(Aloha Editor) or Markdown format, they hit submit and the administrator
                is notified, the administrator reviews the post, hits publish, and the page is pushed to the website.

              <div class="content--inner-text">
                The admin interface uses Angular for the front-end and Node/Express on the back-end with MongoDB. A
                static-site generator(Metalsmith) is used because the website pages are pushed to is static. Metalsmith
                allowed me to easily create templates for different categories of posts.
